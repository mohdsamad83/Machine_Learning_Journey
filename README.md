# Learn NumPy and Pandas

This repository contains my practice notebook as I embark on my machine learning journey.

## Topics Covered Numpy
- NumPy array creation
- Indexing & slicing
- Broadcasting
- Matrix multiplication
- Array statistics

## Topics Covered Pandas 
- Pandas reading a file tab seprated , csv and excel
- Exporting to a new file
- Some useful Statistica summary using df.describe
- Filtering through rows and columns or the entire data frame
- Adding a new column and dropping unwated columns

## What I Learned
NumPy and Pandas are the foundation for all numerical operations and large file handling support in machine learning. Today, I practised arrays, reshaping, and matrix math that are critical for model inputs and data wrangling.
